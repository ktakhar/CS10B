.Statement of Purpose
I never expected to major in computer science until
I was brainwashed by my college advisor.  I liked it
more than I expected and that got me hooked.


.Personal
I have 107 grandchildren, and 33 children
and a bunch of other relatives


.More about me
I like baseball, basketball and I am not
really into computer games
