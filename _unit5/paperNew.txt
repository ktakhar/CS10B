Statement of Purpose
--------------------
I never expected to major in computer science until
I was brainwashed by my college advisor.  I liked it
more than I expected and that got me hooked.

Hobbies
-------
I enjoy playing baseball, basketball, but strangely enough
I'm not so hot on computer games!

Personal
--------
Married with 107 children, 52 grandchildren, and 18 others.
