The three files ...

    - LinkedDequeue.class
    - LinkedDequeue$QueueNode.class
    - DequeueUnderFlowException.class

... comprise a correct implementation of the LinkedDequeue class that can be used with the LinkedDequeueDriver.java program to explore how LinkedDequeue should behave.

The Powerpoint slides describe the circumstatnces under which you can replace them with class files from your own implementation in order to test your implementation.
