A NullPointerException is an unchecked runtime exception that occurs when you attempt to invoke a method on an object that is null. 
This exception often arises due to programming errors and cannot be reliably anticipated during the compile-time phase.

Example: 
String text = null;
int length = text.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException
