PSET3 - Problem 3

The loop doesn't terminate because the program adds an element at position `i` with each iteration increasing the size of the ArrayList.
This creates an infinite loop. To fix the loop, iterate through the ArrayList in reverse order and add "NOT" in front of each word. 

for (int i = a.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    a.add(i, "NOT");
}
